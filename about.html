    <p class = "para--fullspan"> My name is Alun Turner and I'm currently changing careers. I spent 12 years in the RAF
        where I worked as a helicopter pilot and now I'm taking part in a 3-month residential course with Northcoders in Manchester.
        This website is very much a work in progress, and should improve in line with my web development skills.
